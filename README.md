# MongoDB updateOne Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using the `updateOne` method in MongoDB to increment a counter.  The provided code intends to increment the `count` field of a document where the `_id` is 1. However, the `updateOne` operation sometimes fails to increment the counter correctly. This issue arises due to incorrect usage or potential race conditions in the interaction between the updateOne and client connection.

## Bug Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure you have Node.js and a MongoDB instance running.
3. Replace `<your_mongodb_connection_string>` with your actual connection string.
4. Run `node bug.js`.  Observe that the counter might not always increment as expected.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file offers a corrected implementation that addresses the issue by using `findOneAndUpdate` with options to ensure the update is atomic and the updated document is returned to verify the changes.
